Subject: Important Update Regarding My Work Permit Status

Dear Sarah,

I am writing to you today with a heavy heart and a difficult personal update.

Earlier today, I went to the bank to open a Canadian bank account—something I 
haven’t needed until now, as I’ve been using my German account from my previous 
residence. During the process, I was informed that my SIN was not being accepted. 
I immediately contacted Service Canada and learned, to my utter shock and dismay, 
that my work permit had expired.

When I returned home and carefully reviewed my IRCC document, I realized with 
great regret that I had misread the expiry date. The date was written in the 
format yyyy/dd/mm (2026/04/01), which I incorrectly interpreted as yyyy/mm/dd. 
This means my permit expired on January 4, 2026, not April 1, 2026.

This realization has been devastating for me. I had already begun to envision 
joining the PPI engineering team and contributing to your important work. I 
also feel deeply saddened knowing how much effort you and Jennifer have 
invested in bringing me on board so quickly.

My immediate next step is to apply to change my status with IRCC to maintain 
legal presence in Canada. While this will allow me to remain in the country, 
I understand it will not permit me to work without a valid permit or LMIA, 
and I know your timeline is urgent.

It truly hurts to know that my error will cause significant setbacks for 
your team, especially at such a crucial time. From the brief but meaningful 
interactions I’ve had with you and others at PPI, I can genuinely say this 
is a great place to work, and I am deeply sorry for the disruption this has caused.

While I understand that you need to fill this position urgently, I remain 
sincerely interested in PPI and the work your engineering team does. Should 
your hiring timeline allow in the future—and if you are open to reconsidering 
candidates once their status is restored and a new work permit secured—I 
would be honored to reconnect.

This was never my intention, and I take full responsibility for the oversight. 
Thank you for seeing me as a prospective member of your team—it meant more 
to me than you may know.

With sincere regret and gratitude,
Timileyin Adebayo
