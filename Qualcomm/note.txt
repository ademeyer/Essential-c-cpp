Life lessons play a big role in growth and development. 

while I have learned quite alot in life, considering how people 
perceive a subject usually tells more about their personality and less or 
nothing about the subject. The following points highlights why 
I think this is a siginifant life lesson.

Firstly, people who hate cycling would mostly comment on how
cycling can increase the chance of injury or worse, an accident.
And If you suggest to a group of people to play a game of chess; you 
would notice those who kick against it don't understand chess or
don't like it.

In order to understand a person, it is a good practise to intentionally throw
random topic during discussion to  understand them better.

In conclusion, understanding other people plays a crucial role in relating with people at 
work, church or work play. So, I believe this lesson is very vital 
in life.
