SOLID design principle:

  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
    A class should only have one reason to change for
    be responsible for just a single role / task.

  - Open / Closed principle (OCP):
    State that a class should be open for extension
    and closed for modification. Be able to extension
    a class behaviour without modifying Interface.

  - Liskov's Substitution (LSP):
    Derived or child classes must be substitutable
    for their base or parent classes.

  - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
    It states that "do not force any client to
    implement an interface which is irrelevant to
    them".

  - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
    It states that high-level modules should not 
    depend on low-level modules. Both should depend
    on abstractions.
